    <article>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Can Tuna, drained</li>
          <lil>Sliced bread of your choice</lil>
          <li>Sliced cheese of your choice</li>
          <li>2 tbsp Mayo</li>
          <li>1 tbsp Mustard</li>
          <li>1 celery rib, chopped</li>
          <li>2-3 tbsp chopped pickles</li>
          <li>1 tbsp pickle juice or pepperoncini juice</li>
          <li>1 tsp cracked pepper</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
          <li>A few dashes hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl combine all the ingredients (minus the bread and cheese obviously) and mix thoroughly. Be sure the break the tuna chunks apart so it has a nice smooth consistency.</li>
          <li>Generously butter one side of each slice of bread. Add the tuna mix to an unbuttered side of the bread and top with the cheese and another slice of bread so that the butter is on the outside.</li>
          <li>Heat a nonstick pan to medium heat and add the sandwich to the pan.  Can also add extra butter directly to the pan.</li>
          <li>Fry for 3-4 minutes each side until the bread is a nice golden brown and the cheese has melted.</li>
          <li>Remove from pan and cut in half and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can spice it up as you please, I sometimes add dijon or use different spices I have at hand.  Find what tastes best for you.</p>
